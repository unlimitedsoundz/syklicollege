                <p>
                    If English is not your official language, you must prove your proficiency. We accept official tests such as <strong>IELTS, TOEFL</strong>, or equivalent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, a high school or previous degree taught fully in English, or a Grade C or above in English from recognised high school equivalents, can satisfy the requirement.

                    Yes, you can include up to <strong>two programmes</strong> in a single application form. You will need to rank them by preference. You only need to submit <strong>one</strong> application form.

                    Admission results will be published <strong>within less than a week of submitting application</strong>. You will be notified via email and can check your official Admission Letter in the Kestora Applicant Portal.

                    Yes. If you meet the criteria but a programme is full, you may be placed on a waiting list. Available places from the waiting list will be offered until <strong>26 June 2026</strong>.
