                    In accordance with Finnish legislation, tuition fees are mandatory for students who are
                    <strong> not citizens</strong> of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA),
                    or Switzerland, and who are enrolled in English-taught Bachelor's or Master's degree programmes.

                <p>
                    Sykli College partners with <strong>Paygowire</strong> to provide a secure and streamlined international
                    payment experience. This allows you to pay in your local currency with no hidden bank fees and
                    favourable exchange rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Steps to complete your payment:</strong>

                    <li>Select your country of origin and preferred payment method (e.g., local bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallet).</li>
                    <li>Review the payment instructions provided by Paygowire.</li>

                <p>
                    To encourage early enrolment, we offer a <strong>25% reduction</strong> on the first year's tuition fee.
                    This is a significant saving and is highly recommended for all international students.
                </p>

                    <li>You must accept your study offer within <strong>14 days</strong> of receiving the admission letter.</li>
                    <li>The full (discounted) payment must reach Sykli College's account within <strong>21 days</strong> of the admission offer.</li>
                    <li>This discount applies ONLY to the first academic year and cannot be combined with other tuition fee waivers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the payment is not received by the 21st day, the discount is voided, and the full standard fee will be
                    required to confirm your enrolment.

                    We understand that circumstances change. Our refund policy is designed to be fair while ensuring
                    administrative costs are covered.

                    <strong>Partial Refund:</strong> If you withdraw after the semester has started but before the
                    'Add/Drop' deadline, you may be eligible for a 50% refund. No refunds are issued for the current
                    semester after the 4th week of classes.

            <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                    For the <strong>first academic year</strong>, the tuition fee must be paid in <strong>one full
                        instalment</strong> to facilitate the residence permit process. The Finnish Immigration Service (Migri)
                    generally requires proof of full payment for the first year before granting a permit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <strong>subsequent years</strong>, you may choose to pay in two instalments (per semester).
                    However, please be aware that paying in instalments may incur a small administrative surcharge of
                    €50 per instalment.
